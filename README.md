A VIRTUAL TRAIL ROOM project is a digital solution that enables customers to try on clothes virtually before purchasing them.
This technology utilizes deep learning and OpenCV to create a digital representation of the customer and superimpose clothing items onto their image.
By using a camera on a mobile device or computer, the customer can see how the clothes look and fit without physically trying them on.
